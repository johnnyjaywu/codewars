A repo of all CodeWars coding challenges

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Javascript

## Optimizations
To Do: built-in unit testing

## Lessons Learned:

No matter how unoptimized, ugly the code looks, just write down a solution first. Sometimes you are smarter than you think, and other times it is just better to have a more readable code than trying to save a few milliseconds.
